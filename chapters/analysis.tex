\section{Kentico CMS} \label{analysisKenticoCMS}
Kentico CMS is a content management system (CMS) which allows clients to create and manage their web-sites using a single user interface (UI) which is made of tiles, a layout and an edit button. Each tile has its own functionality. The client can rearrange them either by simply dragging them or by pressing the edit button. Pressing the button leads to the tiles having an \textit{X} in the upper-right corner for removing the tile. If place on the dashboard is available, a blank rectangle with a plus in the position of the future tile enables the client to add a new tile from the menu.

taken via print screen from the administration interface of the Kentico 9.0 product and was modified for illustrational purposes.}
  \label{kentico9UI}
\end{figure} 

The functionality in the menu is divided into six categories, namely: Content Management, On-line Marketing, E-Commerce, Social \& Community, Development and Configuration. 
\begin{description}
\item [Content Management] sees to the contents of the client's site such as pages, tables, polls, etc. 
\item [On-line Marketing] enables the client to handle marketing elements. Visitor's behaviour and reactions are taken into consideration. The tiles to be chosen are Email marketing, MVT Tests, Personas and others. 
\item [E-commerce] offers actions which lead to motivating the visitor's behaviour to resemble the client's wished one, managing products and to track sales. These action are for example Buy X get Y discounts, Products and Store reports. 
\item [Social \& Community] makes it possible for the client to maintain the community around the site and its communication. Some of these tiles are for instance Avatars, Chat, Events. 
\item [Development]'s task is to empower the client to administer sources of functionality and programmable elements. This section consists of tiles such as CSS stylesheets, Email templates, Web Part Containers, etc. 
\item [Configuration] The last, in this thesis most important category. This category mostly oversees the overall configuration of the of the Kentico server. It contains the key requirements of KenticoApp.
	\begin {description}
	\item [System] One of those requirements is the System tile. Part of the System are several subcategories. The one of interest, however, is the one called General. It shows general information about the system and system time, the database and statistics of memory, garbage collection, cache and page view. The default value of the refresh interval is 1 second. It can be changed to up to 60 seconds. Other services General provides are Restart application, Clear cache, Clear performance counters and Clear unused memory. 
	\item [Eventlog] is another key feature. It offers a dropdown list of available sites, a list of events, a filter to view specific events and a button to clear the log. 
	The next component to be described is Licenses. Its purpose is to show and add licenses of the client and their details. It also allows the client to Export list of domains. 
	\item [Users] grants the ability to view, add and edit the users, monitor the on-line ones and send mass emails. A filter tool is ready for use for searching users.
	\item [Roles] Users are assigned with roles and this is where these roles are administered. The overview displays all of the site's roles end their details. The client is able to add, edit and delete roles. A dropdown with sites to be chosen is present. 
	\item [Permissions] Roles authorize users to execute certain actions. Permissions define what these actions are. They are managed in this tile. Again, filter options and a dropdown with site names are available.

\section{Web Application Interface} \label{analysisWebAPI}

\section{Mobile applications} \label{analysisMobileApplications}
Mobile apps are more important every day since \textit{no other technology has impacted us like the mobile phone. It's the fastest growing manmade phenomenon ever -- from zero to 7.2 billion in three decades.}\cite{more-gadgets-on-earth-than-people} The platforms, on which these apps run on, can be divided into three main categories: Android, iPhone OS (iOS) and the Windows family of operating systems for mobile devices (WM). The most used operating system (OS) with a share of 68.67\% of all mobile devices as of November 2016, according to \textit{netmarketshare.com} \cite{operating-system-market-share} is Android. It was  released in September 2008 and its native language is Java. With a percentage of 25.71\%, iOS is the second most sold mobile OS and was released in June 2007. Its native language is objective C. The third platform is WM with 1.75\% share. It was first released in November 2010 and the native language is C\#. 

Mobile apps can be divided into three types: Native, HTML5 and Hybrid.
\begin {description}
\item [Native] This type of app is written in the native language of the platform the developer wants to target. It is fast and the behaviour is most intuitive for its users because the developer focuses on that particular OS and its features. The drawback is that for the development of a native app the learning curve is steep which is why an experienced team of programmers is needed and it targets only one OS. If the app has to run on other platforms, it has to be built in their native languages. This is time costly and therefore expensive. 
\item [HTML5] These apps run in a devices browser. They are usually implemented in CSS, HTML and JS. With these languages many programmers have the opportunity to leverage their previously acquired experience, alternatively the skills gained here in web programming. HTML5 based apps run slower than native ones but work on multiple OS. This saves time and money. The disadvantage of cross-platform apps is they are less intuitive. For example an app with android features would be uncommon for iOS users and vice versa. Another flaw of this approach is the inability to use the device's hardware, such as its camera or microphone.
\item [Hybrid] This is a combination of the two above. It is primarily built utilising CSS, HTML5 and JS and is \textit{hosted inside a native application that utilizes a mobile platformâ€™s WebView.} \cite{hybrid-mobile-app} The bridge to native technologies is ensured by tools, for example in this thesis Apache Cordova is used. A WebView is a headless browser, without any buttons and without higher level functionality such as tabs, navigation, etc. The perks of this approach is the small learning curve. Thanks to HTML5 it is cross-platform and the native wrapper allows it to use the device's hardware. It still runs slower than Native but is cheaper when more OSs are targeted.
\end{description}

When creating an app the developer has to consider what approach will be the most effective one. If the graphical performance is crucial, the app should be native. If it has to run on multiple platforms, utilise a device's hardware component and the graphics are not that important, probably hybrid would be the best fit. If the app displays what was sent to it and the has no dynamic graphics then HTML5 should suffice.
