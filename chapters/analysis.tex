\section{Kentico CMS} \label{analysisKenticoCMS}
Kentico CMS is a content management system (CMS) which allows clients to create and manage their web-sites using a single user interface (UI) which is made of tiles, a layout and an edit button. Each tile has its own functionality. The client can rearrange them either by simply dragging them or by pressing the edit button. pressing the button leads to the tiles having an \textit{X} in the upper-right corner for removing the tile. If place on the dashboard is available, a free rectangle with a plus enables the client to add a new tile from the menu. The functionality in the menu is divided into six categories: Content Management, On-line Marketing, E-Commerce, Social \& Community, Development and Configuration. The Content Management sees to the contents of the client's site such as pages, tables, polls, etc. On-line Marketing enables the client to handle marketing elements. Visitor's behaviour and reactions are taken into consideration. Email marketing, MVT Tests, Personas and other. The category E-commerce offers actions which lead to motivating the visitor's behaviour to resemble the client's wished one, managing products and to track sales. These action are for example Buy X get Y discounts, Products and Store reports. The next category is called Social \& Community and makes it possible for the client to maintain the community around the site and its communication. Some of these tiles are for instance Avatars, Chat, Events. The Development section's task is to empower the client to administer sources of functionality and programmable elements. This section consists of tiles such as CSS stylesheets, Email templates, Web Part Containers, etc. The last, in this thesis most important category, is the Configuration category. This category mostly oversees the overall configuration of the of the Kentico server. It contains the key requirements of KenticoApp. 
One of those requirements is the System. Part of the System are several subcategories. The one of interest, however, is the one called General. It shows general information about the system and system time, the database and statistics of memory, garbace colletion, cache and page view. The default value of the refresh interval is 1 second. It can be changed to up to 60 seconds. Other services General provides are Restart application, Clear cache, Clear perfomance counters and Clear unused memory. 
The Eventlog is another key feature. It offers a dropdown list of available sites, a list of events, a filter to view specific events and a button to clear the log. 
The next component to be described is Licenses. Its purpose is to show and add licenses of the client and their details. It also allows the client to Export list of domains. 
The tile Users grants the ability to view, add and edit the users, monitor the on-line ones and send mass emails. A filter tool is ready for use for searching users.
Users are assigned roles and Roles is where these roles are administered. The overview displays all of the site's roles end their details. The client is able to add, edit and delete roles. A dropdown with sites to be chosen is present. 
Roles authorize users to execute certain actions. Permissions define what these actions are and are managed in the tile named the same. Again, a dropdown with site names is available.
