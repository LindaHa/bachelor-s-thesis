\section{Evaluation}
In this thesis we created a mobile app for the administration of KEMS called KenticoApp. To do so we had first to create a web API to operate the KAPI features. The KenticoApp leverages our web API to communicate with the KAPI. 

One of the difficulties which occurred during the fulfilling of this project was for example the use of asynchronous calls. Another complication took place while using the library JQM which simplifies the creating of aesthetically pleasing elements. However, it also sets limitations, e.g. defining the height of an image is burdensome. The reason being that the view of a mobile app should not be larger than the device's screen in the horizontal direction and setting the height of a figure could endanger this fact.

Our app was user-tested by five people. These individuals got acquainted with the KenticoApp and then they completed four given tasks. After that they had to fill a system usability scale (SUS) \cite{sus}, which is made of 10 verdicts and a short feedback. The verdicts where about the effort made when using the app. Each person assigned a number from one to ten to each verdict depending on the agreement where one meant strongly disagree and five strongly agree. After evaluating the answers we concluded the app to be easy to use even without any tutorial but the visual appearance is not very appealing and the functionality was not integrated as intuitively.
