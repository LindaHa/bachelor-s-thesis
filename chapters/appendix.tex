This figure represents the SUS graphically. It is evaluated as the sum of all the answers multiplied by 2.5 and then divided by the number of participants. If the gotten value is higher than 68 the usability of the system is above average. This is approach is a rough estimate on how a system is usable.
The mathematical averages of the answers to each item of our participants were the following: 
\lstset{style=sharpc, numbers=left}
\begin{lstlisting}
	4
	1.2
	4
	1.4
	3.6
	1.6
	4.4
	2.4
	3.2
	1.6
\end{lstlisting}
After applying said technique to get the result of the usability of KenticoApp we got the number 68.5.
